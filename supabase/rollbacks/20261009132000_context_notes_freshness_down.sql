It is due again the moment it progresses or the customer writes. Earlier (eighth review) citation_moved also takes an item whose citation the citation check refuses now, as the story''s ledger read re-checks it: a CRM text loaded from the cache whose CRM time is not kept or is more than 30 days before the job was created, and an old-inbox mail now placed on another job (or from the client''s address on no job while the client has another job, or from before the job''s lead window), not worded, spam, a newsletter or an auto-reply, or with a saved copy on this job or another live job (the judge''s live set); a mail''s copies time it from when one left a live job (context_ledger_mail_copies). Earlier: a legacy mail whose saved copy sits on another job or on no job counts from when it can have joined the job''s evidence (context_ledger_mail_copies: no earlier than that rule''s first apply and the copy''s own landing), in the quick read (for a job with a reading) as in the full one, so a reading built before then is never taken to have read it and the job is due; (seventh review) one whose copy sits on another live job is not this job''s evidence at all: the full read leaves it out, and the quick read, a superset, may only overstate by it and then reads the job in full; a never-read job''s quick read is as before, except that a never-read job whose admitted rows are all CRM texts loaded from the cache (source ghl_sms_cache_backfill) is read in full, since the evidence leaves out one dated before the job''s lead window and so may hold none (then it is no_evidence, never a backfill of nothing). Earlier: the one ledger due judgement per job (the full evidence read only for a job whose reading may have newer evidence or whose only possible evidence is legacy mail; elsewhere a count and newest landed time of the admitted rows decide the same; evidence_rows is then that count): kind backfill (never_read), update (new_evidence: the current generation''s evidence_until is older than the newest admissible evidence), or rebuild (checks_failed: the current reading is a shadow whose checks.passed is false; citation_moved: an item cites a business_events row now gone, off the job or not admissible; reader_changed; late_evidence: the earliest unread row is more than 14 days older than evidence_until, or more than 150 already-read rows follow it). A rebuild of the live reading for a moved citation or a changed reader is not due while a newer passing shadow by the current reader waits for promotion. Blocked: ledger_off, lane_off, not_in_rollout (settings.job_ids is set and does not list the job), not_live, holding_job, no_evidence, busy (a live building generation or a running ledger run), needs_person (three builds in a row failed their checks: context_ledger_failures), backoff (consecutive failed or check-failed runs: 2 hours, 8 hours, the next Perth day, then 7 days; or a building generation that lost its lease in the last 2 hours), outside_window (a backfill or rebuild outside the settings backfill hours; an update is never held).
